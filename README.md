## Features

### Discover feed suggestions
* When viewing a pin, a suggested feed is generated below containing similar images

  <img max-width="650" height="auto" src="https://peridot-seed.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/gifs/peridot_suggested_pins3.gif">
</p>

* Frontend filters generate the suggested feed. Selectors populate the components with pins of the same category 
    and check user ownership to ensure only unique and unsaved pins are displayed.

```javascript
export const selectSuggestedPins = (pins, userId, pinId) => {
    let suggestedPins = [];
    Object.values(pins).forEach( pin => {
        if (pin.id === pinId) return;
        if ((pin.userId !== userId) && (pin.category === pins[pinId].category)) suggestedPins.push(pin);
    })
    return suggestedPins;
};
```

### View other users' pins and boards or create your own
* View an assortment of other users' pins and add them to your own collections.

### Masonry layout
* After fetching, pins are randomized with a shuffling algorithm and individually assigned to a column. 
    The number of columns is caluclated from the current width of the viewport and updated by an event listener on the window. 
    CSS flexbox and animations are used to display the image upon loading.
